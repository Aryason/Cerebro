<h2 id="joseph-bailey">Joseph Bailey</h2>
<p><figure><img src="headshotJoe.JPG"/>
</figure>

Joseph Bailey is soon to be graduating from Oregon State University as a Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering. He enjoys 3D modeling, 3D printing, taking photos and videos with his camera and drone. He is from Grants Pass, Oregon and is the youngest of 8 kids. In his free time, which is limited due to school, he enjoys playing soccer, praying, and being with his friends and family. After college he will be a volunteer missionary for the Oregon State Newman Center in the 2022-23 academic year, and in the following year he plans to discern the Catholic Priesthood. Throughout Project Cerebro Joseph contributed to the CAD modeling of the system, designing the condenser, forming the evaporator, and designing and assembling the plumbing of the system.</p>
<h2 id="alissa-bergquist">Alissa Bergquist</h2>
<p><figure><img src="headshotalissa.JPG"/>
</figure>

Alissa is a Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering Student who will be graduating from Oregon State University June 2022. Alissa specializes in CAD, 3D printing, and manufacturing. Alissa was born and raised in Portland, Oregon where she will be returning to after graduation. In her free time Alissa enjoys playing the piano, cooking, playing board games, and 3D printing. In the Cerebro project, Alissa worked with 3D scanning assembly parts; designing, modeling, and manufacturing components; wiring the system; and creating the assembly’s pushfan array.</p>
<h2 id="sophia-brodish">Sophia Brodish</h2>
<p><figure><img src="headshotsophie.JPG"/>
</figure>

Sophie is a Mechanical and Nuclear Engineering student and will be completing her undergraduate studies in Fall of 2022. She moved to Oregon from the Central Valley of California in 2018. Sophie will be continuing her academic career in the Master’s program for Radiation Health Physics under the advisory of Dr. Steve Reese within the School of Nuclear Engineering and Sciences at Oregon State University. Sophie has been a researcher for the Enhanced Heat Transfer Laboratory (EHTL) at OSU since early 2018 under the mentorship of Dr. Joshua Gess and a subcontractor of Idaho National Laboratories since September 2021. She loves taking pictures with neutrons, building cool machines, and processing data. Her knowledge of finding thermal management solutions came in handy for Project Cerebro where she found herself tasked with designing a vapor-compression system alongside her teammates. And, she exercised her project management skills to keep the team budgeted, on-time, and well fed.</p>
<h2 id="christopher-wise">Christopher Wise</h2>
<p><figure><img src="headshotchris.JPG"/>

Christopher Wise is a student in mechanical engineering and will be completing his undergraduate degree in June of 2022. Christopher is from Tualatin, Oregon and started attending Oregon State University in the fall of 2018. Chris enjoys working on thermodynamic solutions and material selection to engineering problems and his knowledge in the topic aided in the numerical analysis of project Cerebro. Christopher will be continuing his academic career as a graduate student in the Enhanced Heat Transfer Lab here at Oregon State University.</p>
<h2 id="dr-joshua-gess">Dr. Joshua Gess</h2>
<p>Dr. Joshua Gess contrived the idea of creating a portable vapor compression cycle in a hat, and proposed the project in Oregon State’s Mechanical Engineering Capstone department. Dr. Gess served as the team’s advisor and sponsor for the Cerebro project. Dr. Gess is a Professor at Oregon State University who runs the University’s Enhanced Heat Transfer Labratory (ETHL).</p></div>
